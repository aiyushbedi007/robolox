            <ul>
                <li>Reviewing employee details such as their current job role, key achievements, and performance trends.</li>
                <li>Analyzing historical data, such as previous check-in outcomes and past performance records, to identify progress and patterns.</li>
                <li>Conducting the current cycle’s talent check-in by gathering feedback, assessing developmental needs, and identifying key actions for the employee’s growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The goal is to ensure meaningful conversations between Managers and CEO while maintaining a streamlined and secure process for tracking and analyzing talent data over time.
